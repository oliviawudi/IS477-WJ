        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and long-lasting impact on the global economy; therefore, household credit card debt is also influenced. This project aims to investigate how financial literacy and household credit card debt have changed after COVID-19. Our team will be using two large-scale datasets from the years 2020 and 2024 Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED).\n",
        "\n",
        "By comparing the 2020 and 2024 SHED datasets, this project will explore how levels of financial literacy, credit access, and repayment behavior have evolved in response to the pandemic’s lasting economic effects. The analysis will examine demographic variables such as income, age, and education level to identify which groups experienced the most significant changes in credit card usage and debt management. We will also consider economic influences to interpret shifts in household financial behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach combines data integration, cleaning, and statistical analysis to ensure a transparent and reproducible workflow. The findings will provide insights into how households adapted their financial strategies in the years following COVID-19 and last year of 2024 after COVID-19.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The CFPB of Consumer Credit Trends dataset provides monthly, nationwide information on new credit card originations. It includes the total dollar volume of new credit card limits issued to different credit score groups, ranging from deep subprime to super-prime borrowers. The dataset contains both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted lending volumes, allowing analysis of raw lending activity as well as smoothed long-term trends from the year 2007 Jan to 2025 Apr. Each row represents one credit score category for a given month. This dataset helps us understand how lending patterns differ across borrower risk levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset will allow us to enrich SHED respondents’ financial experiences with contextual information about the broader credit environment. Adding the CFPB dataset introduces some challenges in the data integration process, which strengthens the methodological rigor of our project.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall goal is to produce a reproducible, data-integrated analysis that would demonstrate how the pandemic and economic disruptions affect individuals’ financial decision-making and credit outcomes. Through the process of merging these two large federal datasets, we will illustrate multiple aspects of the data lifecycle and other techniques that were learned in class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the technical aims, this project will contribute to a broader understanding of financial resilience: how knowledge, education, and access to certain financial resources influence households to make financial decisions and manage debt in a time of crisis. And by highlighting the difference between 2020 and 2024, we hope to address the importance of promoting household stability in an unstable economic setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Question\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Did the strength of the relationship between financial literacy and household credit card debt change after the COVID-19 pandemic?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Did households with higher financial literacy show smaller increases in debt post-COVID-19?\n",
